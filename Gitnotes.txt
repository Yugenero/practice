Version Control System (VCS)
 - Distributed version Control
 - Coordinates work between multiple developers
 - Who made what changes and when
 - Revert back at any time
 - Local and remote repos
 - You will have usually have a local repository on your machine, which you will then "push" to a remote repsoitory like GitHub

Concepts of Git
 - Keeps track of code history 
 - Takes "snapshots" of your files
 - You decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
 - You can vist any snnapshot at any time
 - You can stage files before committing
 - once you make a commit to a remote repsoitory other developers can pull that information to their machines

Basic Commands
  - git init //initialize local git repository 
  - git add <file> //Add File(s) To Index
  - git status //Check Status of Working Tree
  - git commit //Commit Changes In index when you are ready and put into local repository
  - git push //Push to remote repository
  - git pull //Pull latest from remote repository
  - git clone //Clone repository into a new directory
